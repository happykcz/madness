## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Turnstile not loading
**Solution**: Check console for errors. Ensure script tag in `index.html` is correct. Verify site key in `.env` matches Cloudflare dashboard.

### Issue: "Permission denied" on login
**Solution**: Verify RLS policies are applied. Check that seed data script ran successfully with correct UUID.

### Issue: Dashboard shows "Failed to load"
**Solution**: Check browser console for Supabase errors. Verify team was created in database. Check network tab for failed requests.

### Issue: Routes 404 errors
**Solution**: Remember we're using hash routing. URLs should be `#/login` not `/login`. GitHub Pages requires hash routing.

### Issue: Styles not applying
**Solution**: Clear browser cache. Rebuild with `npm run build`. Check Tailwind config includes correct content paths.
