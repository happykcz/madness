# Tasks: Quarry Madness Scorekeeper

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-project-md/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (tech stack), spec.md (user stories), research.md (decisions), data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API patterns)

**Tests**: Tests are included for critical scoring logic and E2E flows per quickstart.md recommendations.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app structure**: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/tests/`, `supabase/migrations/`
- All file paths are relative to repository root

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 2 - Authentication (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Foundation for all other stories
- **User Story 1 - Climb Logging (Phase 4)**: Depends on US2 (authentication) - CORE MVP
- **User Story 3 - Admin Control (Phase 5)**: Depends on US2 (authentication) - Completes P1 MVP
- **User Story 5 - Setup (Phase 6)**: Depends on US3 (admin framework) - P2 feature
- **User Story 4 - Bonus Games (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 (scoring system) - P2 feature
- **User Story 6 - Overrides (Phase 8)**: Depends on US3 (admin framework) - P3 feature
- **User Story 7 - Privacy (Phase 9)**: Depends on US1 (scoring) and US3 (competition control) - P3 feature
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 2 (P1 - Authentication)**: FOUNDATION - No dependencies, but required by ALL other stories
- **User Story 1 (P1 - Climb Logging)**: Depends on US2 only - Can start immediately after authentication
- **User Story 3 (P1 - Admin Control)**: Depends on US2 only - Can work in parallel with US1
- **User Story 5 (P2 - Setup)**: Depends on US3 (needs admin framework)
- **User Story 4 (P2 - Bonus Games)**: Depends on US1 (extends scoring)
- **User Story 6 (P3 - Overrides)**: Depends on US3 (admin feature)
- **User Story 7 (P3 - Privacy)**: Depends on US1 and US3 (enforces competition rules)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Utilities (scoring-engine, category-classifier) before components that use them
- Data fetching modules before UI components
- Core functionality before styling/polish
- Error handling after happy path works

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel (independent npm installs)
- T010, T011 can run in parallel (independent file creation)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T015, T016, T017, T018 can run in parallel after T012-T014 complete (database first, then modules)

**Phase 3 (US2 - Authentication)**:
- T021 (test) runs first and alone
- T022, T023 implement login (sequential, same feature)

**Phase 4 (US1 - Climb Logging)**:
- T028, T029, T030 all tests can run in parallel
- T031, T032 can run in parallel (independent components)

**Phase 5 (US3 - Admin Control)**:
- T040 (test) runs first
- T041, T042 can run in parallel (independent admin modules)

**Between User Stories** (if team has capacity):
- After Foundational complete, US2, US1, and US3 can start in parallel if assigned to different developers
- US5 and US4 can run in parallel (P2 features are independent)
- US6 and US7 can run in parallel (P3 features are independent)

**Phase 10 (Polish)**:
- T076, T077, T079, T080, T082, T085 can all run in parallel (independent documentation and code improvements)

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# After database migrations (T012, T013, T014) complete, launch together:
Task: "Create base router at frontend/src/router.js"
Task: "Create authentication manager at frontend/src/auth/auth-manager.js"
Task: "Create scoring engine utility at frontend/src/shared/scoring-engine.js"
Task: "Create category classifier utility at frontend/src/shared/category-classifier.js"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Climb Logging)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for scoring engine at frontend/tests/unit/scoring-engine.test.js"
Task: "Unit test for category classifier at frontend/tests/unit/category-classifier.test.js"
Task: "E2E test for ascent logging at frontend/tests/e2e/ascent-logging.spec.js"

# After utilities exist, launch these components in parallel:
Task: "Create route selector component at frontend/src/shared/route-selector.js"
Task: "Create score display component at frontend/src/team/score-display.js"
```

## Parallel Example: Multiple User Stories

```bash
# If team has 3 developers, after Foundational phase complete:
Developer A: User Story 2 (Authentication) - T021-T027
Developer B: User Story 1 (Climb Logging) - T028-T039 (depends on US2 completion)
Developer C: User Story 3 (Admin Control) - T040-T048 (depends on US2 completion)

# Strategy: Dev A completes US2 first, then B and C proceed in parallel
```

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-5 (T001-T048) = 48 tasks for full P1 MVP

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Database schema and RLS policies (Phase 2) are CRITICAL - all user stories depend on them
- Authentication (US2) is FOUNDATION - all other stories require it
- US1 (Climb Logging) is CORE VALUE - the heart of the MVP
- US3 (Admin Control) COMPLETES MVP - enables competition lifecycle
- US5-US7 are ENHANCEMENTS - valuable but not required for first competition
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
