## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### DNS Not Working Yet?
- **Normal!** Can take up to 48 hours (usually 10-30 minutes)
- Check status: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#CNAME/madness.happyk.au
- Verify Cloudflare DNS record is correct (gray cloud, not orange)

### HTTPS Not Available?
- **Wait longer** - Needs DNS to propagate first
- **Check GitHub Pages** - DNS check must be green first
- **Be patient** - SSL provisioning can take 10-20 minutes

### Site Shows 404?
- **Check gh-pages branch exists** - It should (we deployed)
- **Redeploy:** `cd frontend && npm run deploy`
- **Wait** - Sometimes takes a few minutes
