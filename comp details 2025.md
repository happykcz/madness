## About the competition
12 Hours of Quarry Madness — Statham’s Edition (2025)
October 18 @ 6:00 AM – 6:00 PM
Teams of two. 6 am–6 pm. Climb hard, dress loud, feast well.

Quarry Madness is back — and this time we’re taking over Statham’s Quarry for a full-day social comp with festival vibes. Grab your partner (and your best costume) and spend up to 12 hours racking up points on single-pitch routes. You don’t have to climb non-stop — smash a morning session, take a lunch siesta, or go the full grind. Spectators and supporters are absolutely welcome.

Expect fun side comps and chill zones throughout the day (think slackline showdown, knot-off, and pull-ups), a coffee van in the morning, and food trucks for lunch and dinner. Music, prizes, photos — the works. Categories keep it friendly and fair (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), with extra prizes for best dressed, most boulders ticked, and the coveted Spirit of Climbing.

Statham’s delivers a huge spread of bolted sport lines with classic quarry ambiance and a handy day-use setup — perfect for a big community day out. (Climbing & access facts below.) Bring your stoke, sunscreen, and self-sufficient outdoor skills; we’ll bring the buzz. Limited spots — only 27 teams. Registrations open soon. Final program, vendors and timings are subject to change; full run-sheet will be published closer to the day.

# Scoring Structure

## Base points by grade (for all, sport, trad and boulders)

### Rope routes (Ewbank grades)

Your route grade is multiplied by a banded multiplier:

* Grades **≤14** → **0.75 × grade**  
* Grades **15–17** → **1.00 × grade**  
* Grades **18–20** → **1.25 × grade**  
* Grades **21–23** → **1.50 × grade**  
* Grades **≥24** → **1.75 × grade**

Quick examples:

* 16 → 16.0 pts  
* 20 → 25.0 pts  
* 23 → 34.5 pts  
* 26 → 45.5 pts

### Boulders (V-grades)

Boulders are benchmarked to an equivalent rope grade, then receive a **30% reduction** to reflect time efforts for attempts.

Equivalences used:   
V0 ≈ 16, V1 ≈ 19, V2 ≈ 20, V3 ≈ 22, V4 ≈ 23, V5 ≈ 25, V6 ≈ 26, V7 ≈ 28, V8 ≈ 29

Boulders, based points exactly (with 30% reduction)

| V grade | Points | V grade | Points |
| :------ | :----- | :------ | :----- |
| **V0**  | 11.2   | **V5**  | 30.6   |
| **V1**  | 16.6   | **V6**  | 31.9   |
| **V2**  | 17.5   | **V7**  | 34.3   |
| **V3**  | 23.1   | **V8**  | 35.5   |
| **V4**  | 24.2   |         |        |

**All base-points will be rounded.** 

## Trad bonus

Since there are fewer trad lines but they take longer and require more skill/gear:

* \+50% bonus on the base points for trad climbs  
* (e.g. a grade 18 trad \= 12 pts × 1.5 \= 18 pts)

## Repeats allowed, but capped

Allowed repeats of a route, but with reduced points after the 1st time.

* 1st ascent: full points  
* 2nd ascent: 75% points  
* 3rd ascent: 50% points  
* 4th ascent: 25% points  
* 5th+ ascent: no points

(This prevents “laps” farming one easy climb all day.)

## Team scoring

* Teams of two. Score \= **sum of both climbers’ points**.

## Games scoring

- Each game will have a different base value. Games and scores to be announced on the day. 

# Categories

* **Climbers** can register in three categories based on their hardest redpoint on the rock:  

  * **Recreational**: Hardest redpoint up to grade 19  
  * **Intermediate** Usually climbs in the 20 – to 23  
  * **Advanced:** Climbs grade 24+

* **The team** category will be based on the category of the stronger/older climber in the team.  

  * A **recreational team** \- both team members are in the recreational category  

  * An **intermediate team** \- one or both members are intermediate climbers  

  * An **advanced team** \- one or both members are advanced climbers  

  * A **Masters team** \- at least one team member is 50+ or both team members are 45+

    

# Rules

## Safety rules

* Only experienced, self-sufficient outdoor lead climbers are eligible to enter, and by purchasing a ticket, anyone agrees to the Competition Rules & CAWA terms and conditions.  
* Helmets must be worn while climbing, belaying, and near the cliff.  
* Anyone who is observed endangering themselves or others by climbing like an idiot will be disqualified. This includes:  
  * Bolt skipping  
  * General reckless behaviour

## General rules

* Climbers compete in teams of 2\.  
* Climbers are encouraged to wear a fancy dress; however, costumes must be approved as being safe by the head judge, and common sense is advised.  
* Team members belay each other; no external belayers are allowed.  
* Only routes on the score sheet can be climbed.  
* A climb can only be counted if it is lead; a successful "lead" is starting at the bottom, with no top-rope above, clipping gear along the way, and arriving at the anchors with no FALLS, no HANGS, and no PULLING ON GEAR. Trad and mixed climbs must be repointed; pink pointing is permitted on sport routes only.  
* A successful 'second' can also count as an ascent in the competition, however, only on top-out Trad routes. The only routes where this is permitted are \[list the routes\]. On all other routes, only a lead can be scored.  
* Only one climbing party can be on a route at a time. This applies to all single and multi-pitch routes.  
* Stick Clip: Only stick-clipping the first bolt is permitted.  
* Climbers can have two back-to-back goes (successful or unsuccessful) on a climb, after which they have to move on to another climb before returning to it again.  
* If a climber falls on a climb, they can lower down and have a second attempt. If safe to do so, the climber can choose to leave the rope clipped to their high point and yoyo the climb up to their high point and continue the route. If the climber falls on the second attempt, they must try a different climb before attempting the climb again.  
* Teams must submit their electronic or hard copy score sheet (both provided) before the event ends at 6 pm.  
* Cleaning of routes  
  * Climbers must clean climbs after they are finished on the route.  
  * At the base of most climbs will be a set of locking carabiners. The first climber to climb each route will place these locking carabiners on the anchor of the climb. For the remainder of the event, climbers can clip and lower off these carabiners in order to clean the route.
