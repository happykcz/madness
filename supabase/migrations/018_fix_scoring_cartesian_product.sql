-- Migration 018: Fix Scoring Cartesian Product Bug
-- Date: 2025-10-19
-- Purpose: Fix incorrect totals when climbers have both ascents and bonus points
--
-- Problem: LEFT JOIN between ascents and bonus_entries creates Cartesian product
-- causing SUM() to multiply values incorrectly
--
-- Solution: Calculate route points and bonus points separately using subqueries

-- Fix climber_scores view
