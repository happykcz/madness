# Scoring Phase - Complete Specification

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Competition Date**: Saturday, 18th October 2025, 6am-6pm (Western Australian Time)

## üé® UI/UX Design Changes

### Color Scheme Update
- **Background**: Change from `#fafbfc` ‚Üí Light pink (e.g., `#fff5f7` or `#ffe6eb`)
- **Remove Blue**: Replace all blue colors in buttons/badges/links
- **Use Theme Colors**:
  - Primary: `#ff0046` (CAWA red/pink)
  - Secondary: TBD
  - Tertiary: TBD

### Files to Update:
- All page backgrounds
- Button styles (btn-secondary, btn-primary variants)
- Badge colors in admin dashboard
- Link colors

## üë• Team & Climber Categories

### Climber Categories (Individual)
Based on hardest redpoint on rock:
- **Recreational**: Up to grade 19
- **Intermediate**: Grades 20-23
- **Advanced**: Grade 24+

### Team Categories
Based on stronger/older climber (NEW: Masters added):
- **Masters**: At least one member is 50+ OR both members are 45+
- **Recreational**: Both members are recreational
- **Intermediate**: One or both members are intermediate
- **Advanced**: One or both members are advanced

**Priority Order**: Masters > Advanced > Intermediate > Recreational

### Category Classification Logic
```
function classifyTeam(climber1, climber2):
  // Check Masters first
  if (climber1.age >= 50 OR climber2.age >= 50):
    return 'Masters'
  if (climber1.age >= 45 AND climber2.age >= 45):
    return 'Masters'

  // Get individual categories
  cat1 = classifyClimber(climber1)
  cat2 = classifyClimber(climber2)

  // Return highest category
  if (cat1 == 'Advanced' OR cat2 == 'Advanced'):
    return 'Advanced'
  if (cat1 == 'Intermediate' OR cat2 == 'Intermediate'):
    return 'Intermediate'
  return 'Recreational'
```

## ‚úèÔ∏è Team Editing

### Requirements
Admin needs ability to edit:
- ‚úÖ Team name
- ‚úÖ Team category (manual override)
- ‚úÖ Climber 1: name, age, grade, category
- ‚úÖ Climber 2: name, age, grade, category
- ‚ùå Team ID (not editable)
- ‚ùå Password (separate reset function)

### Implementation
- Add "Edit Team" button to team details page
- Form with all editable fields
- Re-calculate category on save (with manual override option)
- Update both `teams` and `climbers` tables

## üéØ Scoring System

### Route Base Points
Each route has base points by grade (applies to sport, trad, boulders):
- Points assigned by grade (e.g., grade 19 = 100 pts, grade 24 = 200 pts)
- Routes with **0 points** = non-scoring routes (for navigation only)

### Trad Bonus
- **50% bonus** on base points for trad routes
- Example: 100 base points ‚Üí 150 points on trad route

### Multiple Attempts (NEW RULE)
Each route can be scored multiple times by same climber:
- **1st tick**: 100% of points
- **2nd tick**: 75% of points
- **3rd tick**: 50% of points
- **4th tick**: 25% of points
- **5th+ tick**: 0% of points (no more scoring)

**Trad bonus applies to each tick**

Example:
- Route: 100 base points, trad
- 1st attempt: 100 √ó 1.5 √ó 1.00 = 150 points
- 2nd attempt: 100 √ó 1.5 √ó 0.75 = 112.5 points
- 3rd attempt: 100 √ó 1.5 √ó 0.50 = 75 points
- 4th attempt: 100 √ó 1.5 √ó 0.25 = 37.5 points
- 5th attempt: 0 points

### Team Scoring
- Team score = Sum of both climbers' points
- Each climber scores independently
- No limit on team total

### Games Scoring
- Each climber can score only **once** per game
- Score manually entered by admin
- Min/max values TBD (need admin config)
